         <b>Oceanside, California</b> is a coastal city in California. It's known 
         for palm-dotted Harbor Beach and nearby Oceanside Harbor, with its marina and shops. 
         To the south, the long Oceanside Pier juts into the Pacific Ocean. The California 
         Surf Museum traces the sport's history with a surfboard collection and exhibits 
         on famous surfers. Sculptures, paintings and drawings from the region are on display 
         at the Oceanside Museum of Art.
